    <div class="Branches"><h2 class="h1">Eight branches of Math</h2><p class="Math_Tree"></p>
        <div class="paragraphs">
          <h3 style="background: linear-gradient(yellow,bisque);  padding: 5px; border:10px double rgb(255, 153, 0); border-radius: 10px/16px;">The first branch</h3>
          <p>1. <em><b>Number Theory</b></em>
             is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and relationships of numbers.
             Instead of calculations and operations, the focus is on understanding the fundamental nature of integers and their patterns.
              In other words, it's like learning the building blocks of numbers.</p>
           <h3 style="background: linear-gradient(rgb(255, 217, 0),bisque); padding: 5px;border: 10px double red; border-radius: 12px/18px;">The second branch</h3>
           <p>2. <em><b>Arithmetic</b></em>
             is a part of mathematics that deals with numbers and basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
             It also covers more complex things like percentages, logarithms, exponentiation, and square roots.
              The word "arithmetic" comes from the Greek word "arithmos", which means numbers.</p>
              <h3 style="background: linear-gradient(yellow,bisque); display: inline; padding: 5px;">The third branch</h3>
              <p>3. <em><b>Geometry</b></em>
                 is a branch of mathematics that studies the shapes and sizes of objects, their relationship to each other and the characteristics of space.
                 The term "geometry" comes from the ancient Greek words "geo", which means "earth", and "metric", which means "measurement".
                 Euclid, the Greek mathematician, is recognized as the "father of geometry". 
                 This field covers angles, shapes, sizes and various geometric objects in both 2D (e.g. circles, triangles, squares) and 3D (3D shapes such as cubes, cones, spheres).</p>
                <h3 style="background: linear-gradient(yellow,bisque); display: inline; padding: 5px;">The fourth branch</h3>
                <p>4. <em><b>Algebra</b></em>
                    is a branch of mathematics that studies variables, symbols, numbers and the rules of working with them. It is a way of representing problems or situations using mathematical expressions. In algebra, we use variables such as x, y, z,
                     and mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
                     and division to create meaningful expressions. Algebra helps to solve equations and determine unknown quantities such as percentages, proportions, and percentages.
                      The key terms of algebra include variables, constants, coefficients, expressions, and equations.</p>
                <h3 style="background: linear-gradient(yellow,bisque); display: inline; padding: 5px;">The fifth branch</h3>
                <p>5. <em><b>Calculus</b></em>
                     is a highly developed branch of mathematics with various levels such as precalculus, advanced calculus, accelerated calculus with multiple variables, differential calculus and integral calculus.
                     It was originally called "infinitesimal calculus" or "infinitesimal calculus" and focused on continuous change, similar to how geometry studies shapes.
                      The main ideas of calculus are limits, functions, integrals and infinite series.</p>
                <h3 style="background: linear-gradient(yellow,bisque); display: inline; padding: 5px;">The sixth branch</h3>
                <p>6. <em><b>Trigonometry</b></em>
                     is a branch of mathematics that studies how the sides and angles of triangles connect. The word "trigonometry" comes from the Greek words: "trigonon" — triangle and "metron" — measure.
                     Trigonometry is the study of the angles and sides of triangles to determine distances and lengths.
                     Functions that show the ratio of sides and angles of triangles are called trigonometric functions. There are six basic trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant.</p>
                <h3 style="background: linear-gradient(yellow,bisque); display: inline; padding: 5px;">The seventh branch</h3>
                <p>7. <em><b>Probability and statistics</b></em>
                     are an important and somewhat underrated part of mathematics. Compared to other branches such as calculus, it is often considered more accessible.
                     This industry uses mathematical concepts to predict likely events by organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data. To make such forecasts, it relies on a set of rules and formulas.</p>
                     <h3 style="background: linear-gradient(yellow,bisque); display: inline; padding: 5px;">The eighth branch</h3>
                     <p>8. <em><b>Topology</b></em>
                         is a part of mathematics that considers the unchanging characteristics of spaces, even if you smoothly change their shape. It is often called the "geometry of a rubber sheet" because,
                         like rubber, objects can stretch and contract without collapsing.
                         Imagine turning a square into a circle without breaking it; this is the transformation we are talking about.
                          However, an eight cannot turn into a square or a circle without breaking.</p>
